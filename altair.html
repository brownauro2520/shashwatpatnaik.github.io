                        CanSat is a student-oriented engineering competition organized by the American Astronautical Society (AAS), designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in aerospace engineering and space-related projects. In this annual competition, student teams are challenged to design, build, and launch a small satellite, known as a CanSat, that fits within the size constraints of a standard soda can. The CanSat must incorporate various sensors and communication systems to accomplish a specific mission, such as collecting and transmitting data during its descent back to Earth. This annual competition is open to teams from universities and colleges. Teams must be able to design and build a space-type system, following the approved competition guide, and then compete against each at the end of two semesters to determine the winners. Rockets will be provided but teams are responsible for funding the construction of their CanSat and all travel/lodging expenses.

                        An element-based computational method based on Glauert's blade element momentum theory (BEMT) model was employed to estimate the geometry by maximizing the coefficient of power through MATLAB's optimization toolbox using the Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver. The dynamic model was developed for the single-wing design through the MATLAB Simulink 6-DOF toolbox to carry out a free-flight simulation of the wing to verify its global stability.
